# Architectural Design Decision Comparison
## Overview
This report compares two architectural approaches for multi-label email classification:
1. **Design Decision 1: Chained Multi-outputs**
2. **Design Decision 2: Hierarchical Modeling**

## Performance Comparison
| Metric | Chained Multi-outputs | Hierarchical Modeling |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Execution Time | 6.44 seconds | 14.35 seconds |
| Relative Speed | 1x (baseline) | 2.23x slower |

## Detailed Results

- Hierarchical approach: [Hierarchical Report](hierarchical\comparison_report.md)

## Trade-offs

### Design Decision 1: Chained Multi-outputs

**Pros:**
- Simpler architecture
- Fewer models to train and maintain
- Consistent interface across all label combinations
- Often better performance for direct multi-label prediction

**Cons:**
- May not capture hierarchical dependencies as well
- Less interpretable results (harder to trace errors)
- Potentially less efficient with large numbers of classes
- Combining rare class combinations may lead to data sparsity

### Design Decision 2: Hierarchical Modeling

**Pros:**
- Better captures hierarchical relationships
- More interpretable results (errors can be traced to specific levels)
- Can handle class imbalance at each level separately
- More flexible for adding new classes at different levels

**Cons:**
- More complex architecture
- More models to train and maintain
- Error propagation through levels can be problematic
- Often slower in training and inference

## Conclusion
Based on execution time, the **Chained Multi-outputs** approach is more efficient. It completed in 6.44 seconds compared to 14.35 seconds for the Hierarchical approach.

The choice between approaches should be based on multiple factors beyond just execution time:

1. **Interpretability needs**: If understanding decisions at each level is important, hierarchical may be better.
2. **Maintenance complexity**: If simpler maintenance is preferred, chained may be better.
3. **Model performance**: Compare accuracy and F1 scores from the detailed reports.
4. **Specific business requirements**: Consider the specific context and priorities.
